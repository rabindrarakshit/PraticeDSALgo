Repo for practising DS and Algo

Categories :

1. Manacher (Max Palindrome Subsequence)
2. Kadane (Max Sub Array (Sum - Make sum 0 when sum is negative)), Max Sub Array (Product) : Maintain min and max at every index and then update the result with max.
3. Three Pointer (Dutch National Flag - Sort 0,1,2)
4. Sliding Window
5. Prefix Sum (Longest SubArray With Sum K (Containing positive and negatives))
6. SubArray
7. Two Pointer
8. Left Rotate By D Places (Reverse complete, then reverse d, and x-d separately)
9. Longest Subarray with given sum -> Prefix Sum
10. Boyce Moore's Algo : Majority Element
11. Sorting : Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Shell
12. Leaders in an array: Maintain max from back and compare
13. Longest Consecutive Subsequence : Sort and check, Set
14. Set Matrix Zeroes (Flooding) : check if first row and column have zeroes, mark it with flags. Then check from i=1 in rows and columns and mark them in first row and column. At last use the first row and column markers to fill with zeroes if marked true.
15. Rotate matrix by 90 degree: Transpose + Reverse
16. Print matrix in spiral: Maintain four flags top, bottom, left, right. Also check boundary conn when left==right and top==bottom.
17. Pascals Triangle: App1: r-1Cc-1, App2: for row n (1-based), first element 1, next ans = ans * (n-i); ans = ans / i; -> print row
18. Repeating and Missing Number : Algebraic Soln : S = n(n+1)/2 , Sum of Squares = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Difference in sum = x-y, and x2-y2 = diff in squares. Solve them.
19. Count Inversions, Reverse Pairs -> Merge Sort
20. Binary Search -> Answers -> Find Min -> return low, Find Max -> return high (Ex: Find Min capacity of ship to ship in d days)
